Learning the Basics of React-Native
Created another todo list

*My own Thoughts*
React-Native is easier to use compared to Vue-Native. I seem to have more control over functions used in iOS and Android.
In terms of code, I think Vue-Native is cleaner, since React-Native requires a lot of component importing. Which is a little annoying. 
In Addition, the brackets are also a pain to use.
